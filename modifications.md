The `Modification` class, found within [Dari](http://www.dariframework.org/javadocs/com/psddev/dari/db/Modification.html) can be used to provide inheritance to multiple object types from one singular class. It is typically used when a property, not common among a group of objects, needs to be added after they have already been created.

Normal inheritance can be achieved as would be expected with Java. Here is an example of an abstract Link class, with an internal link object extending from it.

<div class="highlight">{% highlight java %}public abstract class Link extends Content {

    private String name;

    // Getters Setters

}
{% endhighlight %}</div>

The User interface that is created in Brightspot when extending a parent class is automatically generated.

<div class="highlight">{% highlight java %}
public class InternalLink extends Link {

    @ToolUi.OnlyPathed
    private Record pageContent;

    public Record getPageContent() {
	    return pageContent;
    }

    public void setPageContent(Record pageContent) {
	    this.pageContent = pageContent;
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}</div>


**Example of a Modification, using a common Interface**

A good example use case of implementing a modification would be in the case of a global property, `FacebookLikes` which needs to be recorded on each object, such as `Blog`, `Article`, `Image`, `Author` and `News`. They do not inherit from one global class, therefore there is no quick means to apply the property to them all. In this case, a modification can be used to add the field to all the objects.

**Step 1. Create Common Interface**

<div class="highlight">{% highlight java %}import com.psddev.dari.db.Recordable;

public interface FacebookLikesInterface extends Recordable {

}
{% endhighlight %}</div>

**Step 2. Create your Modification**

<div class="highlight">{% highlight java %}import com.psddev.dari.db.Modification;

public class FacebookLikes extends Modification<FacebookLikesInterface> {

    @FieldIndexed
    private String new;

    // Getters Setters

}
{% endhighlight %}</div>

**Step 3. Implement Modification** 

<div class="highlight">{% highlight java %}public class Author extends Content implements FacebookLikesInterface {

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    
}
{% endhighlight %}</div>

**No Common Interface**

With Dari there is another method by which you can implement multiple inheritance with modifications, without the need for the common interface. By using `Modification.Classes` for a new class, and then defining the classes that are to inherit, you can modify multiple objects from one single class.

**Step 1. Implement Modification** 

<div class="highlight">{% highlight java %}@Modification.Classes({Person.class, Author.class})
public class ExampleModification extends Modification<Object> {

    private String newField;

}
{% endhighlight %}</div>

**When not to use Modifications**

Modifications, while providing the ability to group objects, and apply properties across them all, should not be used to replace sub classes. See below for an example:


Take three objects, `Blog`, `Video` and `News`, none of which have a common class they are abstracted from. The requirement is to query from the three objects, and return a list of the most recent items.

With a modification, a `RecentItems` interface could be created, and the modification could contain the property on which the query would be run, however the limitation is that the interface, which groups them cannot be queried directly. Namely, `Query.from(RecentItems.class).sortDescending('date').selectAll();` will not work. In order for it to work, the methods from your modification would need to be moved into your interface.

At this point, the modification becomes a bad practice for achieving the desired result, and a parent and subclass structure is recommended.
