                <p>Brightspot boasts an intuitive UI experience, coupled with a toolset tailored for the professional publisher. Rich text editing, WYSIWYG formatting, advanced image editing and visual inline publishing allows the editor complete access to manage content quickly and efficiently.</br></br>

                The beauty of the platform is the manner in which it is tailored to suit each clientâ€™s specific requirements. Assets are defined and created with exact structure and terminology, and the UI is automatically generated from your requirements.</br></br>

                This editorial guide will walk through the basic publishing workflow, as well as the tools present in the CMS that make editorial tasks easier.

                        <div style="width:300px!important;"class="description">The search tool can be accessed from any screen within Brightspot. Simply place your cursor in the search field to get started. Start typing to see the results change. As a default, all content types are shown in the results set, however with customizable options to filter with, using the filters on the left, you can specify exactly what you are looking for. You can also sort the results order on certain fields, or only display items with missing content.</br></br>You also have the ability to create new content from anywhere within Brightspot using the create drop-down. Choose from the list of existing objects or start typing to narrow the results.</br></br>Work Steams allow editors to group together content that needs to be edited, and then work through the task quickly. A new work stream is created directly from a set of search results. Narrow your search results to what you want to work through then click to create a new work stream, consisting of those items. The work stream will then appear within the dedicated widget on the dashboard.</div>
