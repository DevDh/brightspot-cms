## Adding Users

Found in Admin -> Users and Roles, Brightspot provides a simple user interface that allows Administrators to add new users, and define their roles.

By default, all new users inherit the same role. This is configured in Admin > Settings, where the default role can be set.

To create a new user add a name, email address and set their password.

## Creating Roles 

Once a user has been created, a `New Role` can be added, with customizable access setup. In the drop-downs you can choose to limit access to specific areas, types or widgets.

## Workflows

Custom workflows can be created for any user role and content type. Build your own workflow, with transitions and statuses that match your editorial flow, and terms, using the intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Click here for a full guide to building a [custom workflow](/workflows.html).


By adding Status boxes, and dragging transitions, workflows can be built for a custom editorial flow. The final transition must move content to the `Published` box.

**Using the Workflow: Controlling Users**

Once a workflow is in place, all users will have the status options available as they create new instances of that content, alongside the normal publish actions. To limit the options available to a user (Only able to submit, not publish content) their role can be updated. Using the Users & Roles tool, select the content type that the workflow is applied to, and remove the ability for a particular role to publish etc. The exact statuses that are created in the workflow appear here.

**Using the Workflow**

The Published Drafts dashboard widget shows all content in a particular status. Clicking into content shows the available actions, and any notes that have been given.
