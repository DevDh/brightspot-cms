## Editorial Tools

### Introduction

Brightspot boasts an intuitive UI experience, coupled with a toolset tailored for the professional publisher. Rich text editing, WYSIWYG formatting and inline image editing allows the editor complete access to manage assets quickly and efficiently.

The beauty of the platform is the manner in which it is tailored to suit each client’s specific requirements. Assets are defined and created with exact structure and terminology, and the UI is automatically generated from your requirements.

This editorial guide will walk through the basic publishing workflow, as well as the tools present in the CMS that make editorial tasks easier.

**Tool Hat**

The Tool Hat is the black toolbar at the top of the screen. It remains visible on all pages in Brightspot. From here you can access your own User Settings, Log-out, change which site you are viewing if using Multisite and implement the [Bookmarklet tool](/brightspot-cms/editorial.html#cms-tools).

**Search**

The search tool can be accessed from any screen in Brightspot. Simply place your cursor in the search field to get started. Start typing to see the results change. As a default, all content types are shown in the results, however with customizable options to filter with, using the filters on the left, you can specify exactly what you are looking for. There is a dedicated section [here](/brightspot-cms/editorial.html#finding-content), which walks through searching for content in Brightspot.

**Create**

Found in the Search tool, you have the ability to create new content from anywhere within Brightspot using the create drop-down. Choose from the list of existing objects.

**Site Map**

The Site Map is a hierarchical view of your website content, showing the structure for the entire site. It is used to either find specific content, or to get a better understanding of the various items within each section.

**Recent Activity**

Using the Recent Activity, you can jump to a piece of content that has just been edited, or scroll through all edits made in one day. It can also be used to verify when content was started and finished by a user. You can also adjust results by filtering between just you and other users.

**Page Builder**

Create a whole new page using Page Builder. Select from a list of existing templates to get started, each one associated with a specific piece of content. These templates are created under Admin > Templates & Sections.

**Schedules** 

Content that is set to go live at a future date appears in the Schedules section. Each day has a section, with any content due to go live on that day visible. Click into the content to edit. Scheduling is set from within the content edit screen, using a date widget. See the dedicated section on [scheduling](/brightspot-cms/editorial.html#scheduling) here. 

**Drafts**

All content that is not yet completed, but saved in a draft status, appears in the Drafts module.

**Page Thunbnails**

Hovering over any content on the dashboard that is an individual page allows you to see a quick inline preview of the page. This allows editors to get a visual idea of what they want to create or edit. Hovering over the eye preview symbol toggles the view.<h2 id="publishing"> </h2>

### Publishing


**Creating Content**

For the following publisher tasks, we will be using a Demo Brightspot instance as an example. This example CMS powers a mock version of a Perfect Sense Digital company website. Your Brightspot interface will not share all of the same items, but these examples should give you an understanding of how to carry out basic editorial tasks.


We are going to start by creating a new a blog post, which will update the Blog Page. From the Dashboard we select ‘Blog Post’, found in the Page Builder section on the right. *(Note, Content that has an assigned Template will appear in the Page Builder section. Creating content from here results in a new page, with a dedicated URL)*

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/select_blog_newdash.png"/></a>



<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/create-blog.png"/></a>

There are lots of options here, but for now, let’s focus on creating our first piece of content.

* We enter a Title, “Our Latest Blog Post.”
* We then, click into the ‘Body’ section. Notice how a toolbar appears. This is your Rich Text Editor, allowing you to style your content, add images and links.
* We add some sample text for the blog post.


**Preview Content**

Now we have our content in place, we can make sure it is looking ok by clicking ‘Preview’, located on the right hand side. If you are using the inline preview, click on the preview bar to slide out the live preview. 

The preview feature provides a preview of our content positioned on our site, and allows us to check and then make edits before the content goes live. *Note: Preview is available on content with an assigned Template, and a URL*

![](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/preview_tool_inline.png)

**URL**

If everything is as it should be we can close our preview window, or slide out the preview tool. The URL is automatically generated, visible in the right rail widget.  The logic at play grabs the headline “Our Latest Blog Post” and creates a URL. Our current headline is too long for our desired URL, so we can select 'Manual' and add item, a simple URL 'demo-blog'. A slash is automatically added before the word demo.

<img class="smaller" src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/change-url.png"/>

We’ve added content, checked it and given it a URL – we’re now ready to publish, by clicking ‘Publish’.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/publish-blog.png"/></a>

**Versioning**

Notice that a new ‘History’ section appears in the right rail once you click publish. In Brightspot we archive all versions automatically.

Also, notice the ‘Create Another’ button that appeared in the top green bar.

**Saving as Draft**

If you are not ready to publish, you have the option to 'Save as Draft', which saves a version for you to access later.
<h2 id="images"> </h2>
Our content is now published. Let’s return to the Dashboard by clicking the ‘Pages & Content’ tab.

**Adding Images**

In Brightspot we can add various items to content as 'Enhancements'.

Clicking into the 'Body' Section of our content, seen below, opens ours Rich Text Editor tools, and we can click 'Add Enhancement'

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/empty-enhancement.png"/></a>

Once clicked you will see a grey 'Empty Enhancement' in your content. Click the Edit link to open the find tool. Here you can either select an existing image or any other content that has been designated as being applicable for inclusion. If you want to add a new object you can do that from here also.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/find-image.png"/></a>


We can search for an image already in the CMS, or upload a new one. Click on it to select, then scroll down to save. Close your enhancement window, you should now see the grey enhancement area populated with your image name. (You will not see the image, just a reference to it. To see the image in place, use the preview tool.)

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/added-enhancement.png"/></a>


Once an enhancement has been added, we can use the same menu to position it within our content. The arrows offer alignment options, and also allow you to shift the enhancement above blocks of text. To try this out move your image to the very top of the article using the up arrow.

Use the preview tool to view your newly added image in place. If it looks good, click publish.

**Editing Images**

With every image object, you have the ability to apply numerous advanced edits. Brightness, contrast and filters can be chosen, as well as orientation changed.

![](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/advanced_image_editing.png)

A new text overlay tool has also been added, allowing rich text to be added to any image and moved to where the editor desires. The text overlay is shown when a crop size has been selected for a given image.

### Finding Content

<h2 id="finding-content"> </h2>
Once content has been published, we can use the search tool to find it. Clicking into the 'Search' field in the top right of the Dashboard page.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/find-blog.png"/></a>

There are several ways in which you can search in Brightspot. The default list is sorted by Most Recent, you can adjust this in the side filters. You can also search within a specific content type, say Images, Blog Posts or Projects. 

Start typing the name of your content, for us it's our new blog post “Our Latest Blog Post”. Once you have found your content, select it so you can make some edits.

**Finding Modules / Pages**

Our mock website homepage has three featured projects presented in a dynamic module. If we want to update this module, we have several options on how to locate it within the CMS.

**1) Find the Module**

Modules may exist as individual items, with only one instance on the entire website, or with multiple versions. For the homepage example there is only one instance of the Featured Projects Module. Using the search tool we can see it appear.

![add img](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/search-dl.png)

Clicking into the Module allows us to edit it. If we want to swap out the Indiewire project for a new client, we can do so easily. Or drag the listed items to change the order.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/dl-view.png"/></a>


**2) Find the page**

Because there are often multiple versions of a module, on various pages, EG SlideShows, finding the required page, and then narrowing down the module is often a great way to locate content. Note, you can also filter by the type "Slideshow" and use a search term to find which instance of it you are looking for.

Every Static, or One-off page for the website is categorized as a Page within Brightspot. In the search tool, using the filter, we can specify a list of all Pages. To get a better result, however, we can simply search for the page by name, in this case, Home Page.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/search-homepage.png"/></a>

Clicking on the Home Page brings us to a template view of the page. We can see all the content contained within the page. The Featured Project section has a link to a Default Featured Projects. Clicking on this brings us to that module, allowing us to edit it.

### CMS Tools 

**Bookmarklet**

Often editors will want to review their web content visually, not from within the CMS interface. When doing so, Brightspot gives you the ability to edit the content from the actual web view, without having to log back into the CMS to make changes.

The Bookmarklet tool that provides this editorial view allows live content can be updated, images changed and if needed, full CMS access at a single click.

The tool is accessed via a bookmark within your browser. Start by logging into the CMS. In the Tool hat you will see a `More Tools` link. Clicking on this opens a small window with another link. Drag this link (Your Bookmarklet trigger) to your bookmark bar on your browser, as seen below.

![](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/bookmarklet_start.png)
![](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/bookmarklet_place.png)

Once in place, visit your site and find a page you wish to edit. Click on the new bookmark to launch the tool on that page. You will then see an overlay of boxes, showing the various items within the page layout. Any module or content with an `Edit` link can be accessed and updated. You can also click `Edit in Full` to be brought into the CMS full content edit view. Save your changes by scrolling down to the `Save` button. Refresh the page to see the changes.

**Managing Content History**

Content is automatically versioned within Brightspot. The right rail widget, found in all content edit views is populated with a new version each time a save or publish is carried out. This allows the user to simply click into an older version to roll-back.


<img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/history-new.png"/>

Within the yellow banner, which is shown when an older version is being displayed, an `Edit History` link allows the user to label a particular version. Providing a new name will create a new list of Named Histories in the right rail, allowing easier tracking of versions.

<img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/history-name.png"/>

<h2 id="scheduling"> </h2> To revert to an older version, click Publish when viewing the desired content to be made current.

**Scheduling Content**

Content does not have to be published the moment it is created. With scheduling, you can specify a time and day for when the content should go live.

Click into content and notice the right rail shows calendar link above the 'Publish` button. 

If we want to set the date for scheduling, simply click into the calendar view, and select a date. The `Publish` button is now `Reschedule`. Once a piece of content has been scheduled it appears in the Schedules widget on the dashboard.

<img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/reschedule.png"/>

<h2 id="admin"> </h2>

<!--### Administration

**Users**

Found in Admin -> Users and Roles, Brightspot provides a user interface that allows Administrators to add new users, and define their roles.

Create a new user, by default, all new users have all access. The `Current Site` allows users with MultiSite access to define the default site for the user. 

<img class="smaller" src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/users-roles.png"/>

Once a user has been created, a `New Role` can be added, with a customizable access setup. In the dropdowns you can choose to limit access to specific types, for example a role can have read only access to an Article. Simple find the object type you want access limited to, and change the check boxes. The `Areas` dropdown controls the top navigation the user sees within the CMS. Giving no access means no Admin access for that role within BrightSpot
