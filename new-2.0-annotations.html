            New annotations are available in Brightspot 2.0. You can see the full documentation for annotations <a target="_blank" href="http://brightspotcms.com/annotations.html">online</a> but here are a few highlights:
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Dropdown</h4>
            Use the <code>@ToolUi.DropDown</code> annotation to turn a short set of returned results into a dropdown list instead of the more robust pop-up search. This is especially helpful if there are only a few results available.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Global Filtering</h4>
            <a href="http://www.brightspotcms.com/widgets.html" target="_blank">Dashboard widgets</a> now offer custom filters for editors. Using the <code>@ToolUi.GlobalFilter</code> you can add any class as a global filter. This annotation is most helpful when there is a global category, like Author, that is used across multiple content types.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Sorting / Filtering</h4>
            Our new search improvements allow editors to sort and filter their results with greater precision. Use the two new annotations, <code>@ToolUi.Filterable</code> and <code>@ToolUi.Sortable</code>, to specify fields within an object that can be sorted or filtered. Do your editors want the ability to sort articles by total page views? Add this annotation to the field to give them this kind of option. (Note: These fields must also be @Indexed). 
            <br />
            <br />
            Improvements in search, combined with custom filtering, allow developers and editors to work together to make finding content easier. Working with your editorial team to define new sorting and filtering options will unlock the potential of these powerful new features for them.
