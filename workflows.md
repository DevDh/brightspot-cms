Custom workflows can be created for any user role and content type. Build your own workflow, with transitions and statuses that match your editorial flow, and terms, using the intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Creating a new Workflow

Start by navigating to Admin -> Workflows. Create a new workflow, name it and select the content type you would like to apply the workflow for. Save.

## Adding a Status

Click `Add Status` to start creating the workflow. This will be the status the item is placed in as it moves through the workflow. An example would be `Submitted`. You can drag these status boxes anywhere within the workflow space.

## Adding Transitions

Having created the statuses that you need, start with `New` and click `Add Transition`. Drag the transition to the appropriate status and click. A transition label box will appear. This is the label for the transition, example `Submit`. This will appear on the action button for the editor.

Using the Status boxes, and the transitions, build out the workflow, with the final transition moving to the `Published` box.

## Using the Workflow

Once a workflow is in place, all users will have the status options available as they create new instances of that content, alongside the normal publish actions. To limit the options available to a user (Only able to submit, not publish content) their role can be updated. Using the Users & Roles tool, select the content type that the workflow is applied to, and remove the ability for a particular role to publish etc. The exact statuses that are created in the workflow appear here.

The Published Drafts dashboard widget shows all content in a particular status. Clicking into content shows the available actions, and any notes that have been given.
