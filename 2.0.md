**Advanced Image Editing**

Editors now have the ability to apply numerous advanced edits to an image within Brightspot. Brightness, contrast and filters can be chosen, as well as orientation changed.

A new text overlay tool has also been added, allowing rich text to be added to any image and moved to where the editor desires.


<a id="cropping"></a>
**New Image Crop UI**

The user interface for cropping images has been updated, with a preview of each crop now shown. Dragging and changing the crop area updates the preview automatically. Crops with the same aspect ratio can now be grouped together, to make the interface cleaner.


<a id="richText"></a>
**New Rich Text Editor**

The original Rich Text Editor for Brightspot, CKEditor, has now been replaced with WYSIhtml5. The intuitive user interface remains unchanged, and formatting irregularities seen with CKEditor are resolved. The link widget within the rich text has been replaced, and issues surrounding adding enhancements have been fixed. Also, when pasting from Microsoft Word formatting bugs have been resolved.


<a id="inlinePreview"></a>
**Inline Editorial Preview**

Editors can now take advantage of an Inline Preview tool, showing their page content live, alongside the content edit screen. Changes made to content, such as images or text are reflected immediately in the preview view. 

A 'Live Page' link, to access the url in browser as well as the standard 'Share' tool are also included in the new layout.

The preview can be hidden or turned off within the CMS, for editors wishing for the classic preview pop-up view.

<a id="inlineEditing"></a>
**Inline Editing**

The inline editing tool formerly known as the Bookmarklet has been upgraded. Users who are logged into their CMS will now have the ability to edit any content from the front-end of their site automatically, without configuration. All content is displayed as editable, rich text, images and modules. For every page and piece of content an "Edit in Full" option is also available, allowing content discovery to be carried out visually, when editing your site.

<a id="previewThumb"></a>
**Preview Thumbnails**

All pages can now be previewed within the CMS, without having to open a new content edit screen. Click on the the eye icon beside a page to see a live preview of the page. This can also be used to preview scheduled content, drafts, or even new pages.

<a id="createCopy"></a>
**Quick create and copy**

When creating multiple pieces of content that share similar properties, with slight variations in a field, an exact copy can be made. The tool can be useful in speeding up editorial tasks.

An editor can create a new instance of the object with all the previous object fields intact. These can then be edited as required, and Published as a new instance.
