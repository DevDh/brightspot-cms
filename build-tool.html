            The Build tool was designed to give you access to your application status, right from within Dari. You can keep track of build history, code commits, and other app specific information. We currently support external services GitHub, Hudson and JIRA. Access your application build tool at _debug/build 

            To enable the display of this information add the configuration to your project pom.xml file.

            When fixing a JIRA bug, a reference to the bug code, EG ABC-123 should be added to the commit message. This is then linked automatically in the Build tool. Multiple bug references can be added to one commit, all will be linked individually. Clicking on the SCM link brings the user to the exact line of code that was changed within version control.
