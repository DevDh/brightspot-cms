## Adding Images

In Brightspot you can add items to content as 'Enhancements'.

Clicking into a rich text area content, seen below, opens the Rich Text Editor toolbar, click 'Add Enhancement' to open the menu.

Once clicked you will see an 'Empty Enhancement' in your content. Click the Edit link to open the find tool. Here you can either select an existing image or any other content that has been designated as being applicable for inclusion. If you want to add a new object you can do that from here also.

You can search for an image already in the CMS, or upload a new one. Click on an image to select, then scroll down to save. Close your enhancement window, you should now see the enhancement area populated with your image name in a grey box. Clicking publish on the content will show the actual image inline.

Once an enhancement has been added, you can use the same menu to position it within your content. The arrows offer alignment options, and also allow you to shift the enhancement above blocks of text. To try this out move your image to the very top of the article using the up arrow.

Often images are added to a piece of content outside of a rich text area, an example would be a promo image, or gallery of images. The process is the same.

## Bulk Image Upload

Multiple image files can be uploaded at once in Brightspot. On the dashboard, use the `Bulk Upload` widget to select files, or drag and drop onto the widget.

Once uploaded, the new files are moved into Draft status, and can be accessed in the Drafts widget on the homepage, where each can be populated with the correct metadata.

## Image Editing

With every image object, you have the ability to apply numerous advanced edits. Brightness, contrast and filters can be chosen, as well as orientation changed. Any changes made can be reset. Edits apply to each crop, so each version of a crop can have different image edits.

The text overlay tool allows rich text to be added to any image and moved to anywhere on the crop. The text overlay is added by clicking "Add Text", which is found beside a given crop size. Each crop can contain a new overlay.

## Cropping Images

Predefined crop sizes are found to the right of an image. These are grouped by aspect ratio. Click on your desired crop and resize and drag to overlay the area you would like to show. The crop preview on the right helps you to see the final view.

New crop sizes are added by a developer through the Standard Image size option, in Admin > Settings. The name appears for editors, and the internal name and dimensions are added and referenced in the object JSP where the crop is being used. For more information on setting up new crops, see the [Image documentation](/image-cropping.html).
