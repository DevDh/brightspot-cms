                <p>Did you know that Brightspot automatically stores all the content you publish? Saving, referencing and re-purposing work you've already done makes for a more efficient publishing process. Historical snapshots save you time by giving you an easy way to name and find the things you want to save.</br></br>To save a version of something in the past, click on it in History, found in the right rail. You will get a prompt that says, "This is a past revision..." Click on the link for "Edit Revision Name" and name your historical snapshot. It's that easy. Once saved, your re-named version will appear at the top of the History widget in the right rail.</br></br>
