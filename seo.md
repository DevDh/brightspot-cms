## SEO Optimization

All content that is assigned a URL appears within the CMS above a global SEO widget (Found at the bottom of the content edit page). This widget, when populated, provides SEO Title, Description and Keywords that overwrite the defaults from the content itself.

Within the respective .jsp files these fields must be chosen specifically, so as to appear on the front end.

By clicking on `Raw Content` found to the right of `Save Draft` in the content edit screen, and shown as a wrench icon, a view of the SEO fields can be seen in code.

    "cms.seo.title" : "Our New Title",
      "cms.seo.description" : "This description is very different from the default",
      "cms.seo.keywords" : [ "Added", "Are", "Here", "Keywords", "Shown" ],
      "cms.directory.pathsMode" : "MANUAL",
      "cms.directory.paths" : [ "8b48aee0-42d1-11e1-9309-12313d23e8f7/seotest" ],
      "cms.directory.pathTypes" : {
        "8b48aee0-42d1-11e1-9309-12313d23e8f7/seotest" : "PERMALINK"
        
A typical implementation would be to test to see if an SEO Title has been added. If not, the standard object title can be used instead.

	<title>Perfect Sense Digital<c:if test="${!empty seo.title}" >: <c:out value="${seo.title}" /></c:if></title>
	
Using the wireframe tool on a particular page, we can see the JSTL expression needed and available within our header section, to render the SEO content.
