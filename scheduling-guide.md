## Overview

Content does not have to be published the moment it is created. With scheduling, you can specify a time and day for when the content should go live.

## Single Scheduling

Click into content and notice the right rail calendar link above the 'Publish` button. Make changes to the content, then open the calendar view and pick a date you would like the content to go live.

Once a date has been picked click `Schedule`.

If you want to reset the date for scheduling, simply click into the calendar view, and select a date. The `Publish` button will show `Reschedule`. 

Once a piece of content has been scheduled it appears in the Schedules widget on the dashboard beside the date for when it is due to go live. You can always go back into a piece of content and edit the version that is set to go live. It is shown in the right rail, in a schedule widget.

## Bulk Scheduling

If you want changes for multiple pieces of content to go live all at the same time you can group these changes together, to trigger a single scheduled event.

From the Schedules widget on the dashboard, click to create a New Schedule. Add a name for the grouping, and set a trigger date. This can also be left blank (N/A), which allows for open ended scheduling, to be set at a later date when you know when you want to push the changes live.

Once you've created a schedule, you are placed into Schedule Mode. A red bar appears at the top of the CMS.

All edits made while in schedule mode are tracked as part of the schedule. When you edit content you are scheduling the edits, not publishing. The publish button always reads schedule.

You can keep track of all the content you have made changes to by clicking on the current schedule. You can also edit the name, or change the trigger date.

You can exit schedule mode (Click Stop Scheduling) and re-enter at any time by viewing all open schedules from the dashboard widget. Clicking Stop Scheduling takes you out of the scheduling mode, and keeps your schedule saved.

*Note: When in schedule mode within the CMS, all the front-end content displays as it has been scheduled, allowing you to preview all changes to your content. When you stop schedule mode the site returns to the current state*
