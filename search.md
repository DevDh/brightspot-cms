Once content has been published, you can instantly use the search tool to find it. Clicking into the 'Search' field in the top right of the Dashboard page, or any page globally brings up the search tool.

There are many ways in which you can narrow down your content in Brightspot. Typing automatically filters based on a full text search, and using the filters on the left, you can specify the exact type of content you wish to search within. You can also search for content which is missing using the filters.

You can also search by content status, whether it is within a workflow, drafted or published.

The search is also persistent, and can be reset using the reset link.

Once content has been accessed using the search tool, the results are still available, allowing an editor to click through results quickly in the content edit screen:

## Saved Searches

Editors can save favorite searches, and load the results at any time. Once you have conducted your search, click 'Save Search' and label it.

Now, in the top right of the global search you have your saved searches. These are on a per user basis and can be accessed from any search tool, either globally or in the content edit view.

## Color Search

Where applicable, color can be used to search for images. Choose Image as the content type to search within, then use the color picker to choose a color. You can also add text search terms to narrow. The images returned will be a close match to the hex value set in the color picker.

Every image added will have a Colors view, that allows you to see exactly which Hex values are stored on it. These are dynamically rendered from the image when it is added to the CMS.

## Creating Work Streams

Work Steams allow editors to group together content for editing, and then work through the task quickly. A new work stream is created directly from a set of search results. Narrow your search results to match the content you want to work through, then click to create a new work stream, consisting of those items. The work stream will then appear within the dedicated widget on the dashboard. Note, you must narrow the search to a single content type when creating work streams.

## Advanced Search (2.3)

Advanced search is built into the global search in Brightspot 2.3. Click into the Advanced Query Builder to perform advanced searches.

Using Advanced Search you can build complex queries based on AND, OR or NOT matches. Below are some examples:

Search for all Articles within the News section of the site, that were published between specific dates:
