            Hello Brightspot users and developers! We are happy to announce that we recently released version 2.0 of Brightspot CMS.
            </br></br>
            Development of Brightspot started in 2008, and we are excited to show you the latest and greatest features of the platform. Along with a stable release of 2.0 we have given the CMS a fresh look and feel, and a brand new support portal. We hope you like it as much as we do!
            </br></br>
            We wanted to start a weekly newsletter, to make sure that you’re kept informed about all we are doing within Brightspot, as well as helping you get the most out of the tool as you create great content and build unique experiences with our technology.
            </br></br>
            We hope to walk you through some of the newest features each week, as well as recapping on some of the great capabilities already found in previous versions of Brightspot that you may not currently use. Alongside an editorial tip we will take a look at a technical solution.
            </br></br>
