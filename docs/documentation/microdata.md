## Overview

Web pages have an underlying context that the user understands when they access the pages, however search engines have a very limited understanding of what the content is on the page being crawled.

By adding additional tags to the HTML of your web pagesâ€”tags that give it content, you can help the search engines and other applications better understand your content and display it in a useful, relevant way. Microdata is a set of tags, introduced with HTML5, that allows you to do this.

## Implementing

Start by finding a content type within your project that you would like to give a search engine more context to. In this example we have chosen our Article object:

{% highlight java %}
public class Article extends Content implements Directory.Item {

    private String headline;
    private Author author;
    private ReferentialText body;
	
    // Getters and Setters
}
{% endhighlight %}

Access the [schema.org](http://schema.org/docs/full.html) site to find the matching schema instructions for your chosen type. We found the [Article](http://schema.org/Article) schema.

Match the available tags with the fields that exist on your object. We have highlighted the following:

{% highlight html %}
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">

<span itemprop="name">Article Name</span> or <span itemprop="headline"> Article Headline</span>

<span itemprop="author">Author Name</span>

<span itemprop="articleBody">Body Text</span>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

**Add to your JSP**

Once you have determined the relevant tags that you can add, place them into your jsp:

{% highlight jsp %}
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">
    <h1><span itemprop="headline"><cms:render value="${content.headline}"/></span></h1>
    <h5>Written by: <span itemprop="author"><c:out value="${content.author.name}"/></span></h5>
    <span itemprop="articleBody"><cms:render value="${content.body}" /></span>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

## View Output

To see the output of the tags, and check the content being highlighted for the search engine, access a page which you have implemented the tags on, and add `?_format=json` to the URL.
