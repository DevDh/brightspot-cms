## Overview

What drives the direction and substance of your content? Do you have rules and guidelines to help the editorial staff? With Brightspot, Production Guides are built into the tool automatically, allowing those who set the agenda for content creation to document it in great detail.

A simple to use interface enables each page, module or content type to have a corresponding guide, that allows production values, rules and tips to be made available to each editor as they create the content themselves.

No configuration is needed, the guides automatically appear for each page, your role as an editor is simply to write the guide for the content.

## Creating a Guide

Found within Admin -> Production Guides, Editors can create a guide for each page that exists in the CMS. This allows every publishable page to have corresponding programming instructions.

**Step 1.** Start by selecting the page you would like to create a guide for on the left.

**Step 2.** Create a summary. The summary is the overview for the entire page.

**Step 3.** Pick an example page. The example page template will be shown to editors as a perfect example of what they should be replicating. This can be in the form of a screenshot, or an actual live piece of content.

**Step 4.** Every section found on the page can be documented, with an adjoining description added. As Editors browse the guide they can see each section highlighted, with the guide shown.

## Field Instructions

Each field within an object can have instructions added. Within Admin -> Guides select an object type on the left. Each field within that object can have descriptive text added. This is made available to an editor creating content by clicking on the `?` icon for each field.
