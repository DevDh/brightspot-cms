New to Brightspot in Vesion 2.2, the Looking Glass feature was designed to aid in the preview of content across multiple windows, browsers and devices.

#### Opening a new Looking Glass window

At the top of any CMS window, beside your user Profile link, you will now find a History link. This shows you the items you have recently viewed.

Within this pop-up you will also find a Looking Glass link. This opens a new window (See below). To open the Looking Glass on a mobile device simply scan the QR code in the pop-up, which opens the window on your mobile phone or tablet.

This preview window shows the front-end view of whatever piece of content you are looking at or editing in the CMS.

As you move around within the CMS and edit new pages, the front-end view shows a live preview of these edits. As you add text or images and make changes the Looking Glass window updates to give a live preview of your changes.

This allows you to see a page in various browsers or devices while controlling the content on one desktop device.

The Looking Glass URL can be sent to anyone with CMS credentials - allowing collaboration and screensharing capabilities. Also, if you look at the front-end of your site the Looking Glass window will follow you around, showing the same content you are looking at.

There are several views that you can switch between within the Looking Glass window. You can switch to Edit View, which shows you the content in the CMS, or Debug View, showing the page load time in a waterfall view.

For developers you can see the Grid layout for the page, as well as any HTML API that is constructed for the page.
