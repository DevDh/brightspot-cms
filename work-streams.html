                <p>With Brightspot, you can use search to create publishing tasks, called Work Streams. Using Work Streams, multiple users can work on the same task at the same time without the risk of undoing each other’s work. </br>

                    </div>
                    Here’s how. To create a Work Stream, click on the search bar in the top right of the dashboard. Then sort by content type (example: Gallery) and enter your search criteria. Once the results show up, click “New Work Stream” in the bottom left. Once you name and save your Work Stream, it will appear in the Work Stream widget on the dashboard. All the results contained in your search will be added to the Work Stream. </br></br>

                    </div>
                    <p>You can start and stop a Work Stream at any time – plus, you can view who else on your team is working with you on a specific task, and Work Stream manages the flow so you’re never working on the same asset. The assets in the Work Stream will have a new section showing how many tasks are left until you complete the Work Stream. </br>
