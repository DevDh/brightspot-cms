## Adding Users

Found in Admin -> Users & Roles, Brightspot provides a simple user interface that allows Administrators to add new users, and define their roles.

By default, all new users inherit the same role. This is configured in Admin > Settings, where the default role can be set for all newly created users.

To create a new user add a name, email address and set their password. The notifications and two factor authentication options are also available here, if your project has been configured to use them.

## Creating Roles 

Once a user has been created, a `New Role` can be added and assigned, with customizable access provided. In the drop-downs you can choose to limit access to specific areas, types or widgets. For example a Contributor role may not have access to the Admin area, or the Homepage object type.
