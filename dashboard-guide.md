## Accessing the CMS

The default URL for access to Brightspot is *www.yoursitename.com/cms*. Once logged in you will land on the Dashboard. Here you will find widgets for content discovery and creation, your navigation to other areas of the CMS, a global search, and access to admin and settings. The various components of this view are detailed below:

## Tool Hat / User Profile

The Tools at the top of the screen remain visible on all pages in Brightspot. From here you can access your own user profile settings, including changing your time-zone, logging-out and changing which site you are viewing if using Multisite. You can also enable two factor authentication for login, or notifications for workflow submissions. (Note, notifications need to be enabled)

## Search

The search tool can be accessed from any screen in Brightspot. Place your cursor in the search field to get started. Start typing to see the results change. As a default, all content types are shown in the results set, however with customizable options to filter with, using the filters on the left, you can specify exactly what you are looking for. You can also sort the results order on certain fields, or only display items with missing content. From within search you can also create new content, start a work stream, or launch advanced searches.

### Create New

Found within the Search tool pop-up, you have the ability to create new content from anywhere within Brightspot using the create drop-down. Choose from the list of existing objects or start typing to narrow the results.

### Work Stream Creation

Work Steams allow editors to group together content for editing, and then work through the task quickly. A new work stream is created directly from a set of search results. Narrow your search results to match the content you want to work through, then click to create a new work stream, consisting of those items. Add instructions to give editors more context. The work stream will then appear within the dedicated widget on the dashboard.

## Dashboard Layout

Each CMS user can customize their own dashboard view, moving the widgets around to suit their workflow. Hover over the top right corner of a widget to move. Click on an arrow direction to move the widgets around. You you can also collapse an entire widget using the collapse icon in the top right of each widget.

## Site-map

The Site-map widget is a hierarchical view of your website content, showing the structure for the entire site. It is used to either find specific content, or to get a better understanding of the various items within each section. You can also filter a directory to show a particular object type within it. For example, all Blogs within the News directory. You can start typing on the content type of url to filter.

## Recent Activity

Using the Recent Activity, you can jump to a piece of content that has just been edited, or scroll through all edits made in one day. You can also adjust results by filtering between content types or other roles or users. Example, showing all recent Blogs written by John.

## Common Content

Create new content using this widget. Select from the list to get started, each one associated with a specific piece of content. Creating a new page creates content that can be accessed at a new URL. Click customize to hide certain content types you don't typically use, to keep the interface clean. This setting is on a per user basis, so you can set the dashboard up as you like it.

In Admin > Settings > Dashboard you can customize the list of content types that appear as default in this widget. The left column contains content that is newly created, the right column allows editors to edit existing content quickly. Examples here would be a Homepage object, or a module that is updated regularly.

## Work Streams

Once a work stream has been created from the global Search it appears in the dashboard widget. Click start to get to work on the task, or click into the users link to see who else is working on the work stream. Once within a work stream, the right rail of your content edit screen shows the work stream options, including skipping content, and your progress. You can delete finished work streams from this widget also.

## Bulk Upload

Upload files in bulk right from the dashboard. Clicking on Upload Files provides a popup window, where you can choose your file type, and upload in bulk. Alternatively, drag and drop your files in the widget to get the same view.

The bulk upload allows all uploaded files to be saved with bulk information, provided in the form. This allows you to edit in bulk as you upload.

## Schedules

Content that is set to go live at a future date appears in the Schedules section. Each day has a section, with any content due to go live on that day visible. Click into the content to edit. Scheduling is set from within the content edit screen, using the date widget.

From the Schedules widget you can create new Schedules, where multiple pieces of content can be grouped to all go live together. See the [Scheduling Section](/scheduling-guide.html) for documentation.

Content that is within a Workflow, example Submitted / Rejected, also appears here, and can be accessed using the filter.

## Resources

The resources widget allows you to create custom links to content, internal or external that you want access to from within the CMS. Add as many links as you like from within Admin > Settings. You can also directly upload files, such as PDFs. Note: If no links are set, the widget will not appear.

## Quick Preview

Hovering over any content on the dashboard that is an individual page shows a quick inline preview of the page. This allows editors to get a visual idea of what they want to create or edit. Hovering over the eye preview symbol toggles the view - click it to see the page.
