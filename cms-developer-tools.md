## CMS Developer Tools

With Brightspot CMS there are a number of tools that make life easier for the developer. We're going to take a look at the Wireframe and Preview Tool, both of which assist when building out page templates.

### Preview Tool

The inline preview tool provides the ability to see a visual representation of a page right within the CMS. Any changes made to the page template, or content are seen automatically, and a `Mode` drop down allows the choice of view to be changed, with developers now able to run the [Contextual Debugger](/brightspot-cms/debugging.html) inline. Production mode can also be viewed using the drop down.

When using a smaller screen size, the preview tool slides to the right, hidden out of sight, it can be moved into view by toggling the top bar.

The live page link now opens a new window with the previewed page, and the share tool allows a non published piece of content to be shared with another user.

### Wireframe Tool

Also available within the inline preview, the wireframe tool uses the page template to create a wire framed visual of any page. With the ability to be triggered from any Brightspot built page, the tool is switched on by  adding `?_wireframe=true` to a page URL.

The page sections are now shown, each with the respective content chosen, or not chosen. The tool clearly shows any gaps in development, as well as providing a detailed list of all the JSTL hooks available for each section. The drop down menus for each section highlight the properties available on that page section.
