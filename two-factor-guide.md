Editorial access to your CMS is the most direct and most damaging way in which you may be attacked. Even strong passwords can be compromised through spear phishing. This is why Brightspot has two factor authentication, built-in. To enable the two factor auth, open the profile pop-up found at the top of the CMS. Using your smart phone, with a service such as [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447) scan the QR Code. You will be sent a code. Enter the code into the profile pop-up.

Now, on log-in, email and password, as well as the code on their phone will need to be entered. The Google Authenticator app has settings for time-out of the code to control how often it needs to be entered or changed.
